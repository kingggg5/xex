# Harness Index

- Schema version: 2
- Project ID:
- Memory store: `MEMORY.json`
- Active run ID:
- Active state: INTAKE
- Active workflow: `WORKFLOW.md`
- State authority: `STATE.json`
- Last verified:

## Load order

1. Applicable platform, user, and repository instructions.
2. This index, `CONFIG.md`, `IDENTITY.json`, and `STATE.json`.
3. Active `WORKFLOW.md` and its current-turn overrides.
4. Query-selected, verified records from authoritative `MEMORY.json`, then an authorized global `MEMORY.json`.
5. Only optional annexes activated below.

`CONTEXT.md`, `PREFERENCES.md`, and `DECISIONS.md` are readable projections. Never use a stale projection instead of `MEMORY.json`, and never edit generated record rows directly.
