# Loop Engineering

Loop Engineering moves repeated prompting into a bounded supervisor contract. Use it only when a task needs repeated build-and-verify work, a durable goal, a schedule/event trigger, or autonomous task discovery. Ordinary one-turn and short sequential work stay on the normal Harness workflow.

The portable contract is `.harness/LOOP-CONTRACT.json`. It describes intent and limits; it does not schedule work, meter usage, execute a verifier, launch agents, grant permissions, or authorize an external action. A backend that cannot truthfully report and enforce a declared budget is not ready for unattended use; fall back to one bounded iteration.

When a validated loop needs durable local receipts across process or model restarts, Project Manager may add the optional [loop runtime ledger](loop-runtime.md). The ledger enforces contract binding, delivery dedupe, one lease, accepted Git lineage, evidence digests, received usage, and stop state; the host still supplies every real scheduler, worker, verifier, meter, and kill action.

```text
trigger → select one bounded objective → act → verify → record evidence
   ↑                         stop ← decide ← compare with accepted best
```

## Choose the lowest useful level

| Level | Delegated responsibility | Valid trigger | Use when |
|---|---|---|---|
| `turn` | One bounded act/verify pass | Human | A short one-off still benefits from an explicit verifier |
| `goal` | Stopping condition and next iteration | Human | A migration, optimization, or multi-hour task has measurable completion |
| `scheduled` | Wake-up cadence as well as goal | Schedule | The same bounded check must recur and the scheduling backend is verified |
| `proactive` | Bounded task discovery/triage as well as trigger and goal | Schedule or event | A trusted source can yield work through a closed policy and dedupe key |

Start one level lower when it can solve the task. `scheduled` and `proactive` are capability claims, not prompt phrases. If the host cannot prove scheduling/event delivery, overlap handling, status, and cancellation, run one interactive bounded iteration and hand back the next command.

## Create and validate the contract

Copy the starter without overwriting an existing run contract, bind it to the active Project ID, Run ID, and rollback commit, then validate:

```text
npx github:kingggg5/harness loop-validate --contract .harness/LOOP-CONTRACT.json
```

The contract requires:

- one observable outcome, a reproducible current baseline, explicit `done_when` statements, and excluded scope;
- at least one deterministic verifier named by a safe `command_id`; the backend resolves it through a reviewed, read-only capability registry outside the untrusted contract;
- optional judge/human checks that supplement rather than replace deterministic evidence;
- iteration, elapsed-time, token, cost, external-call, failure, no-progress, run, and parallelism ceilings;
- read/write scope, execution strategy, rollback revision, side-effect class, and mandatory human gates including architecture changes;
- a trigger dedupe key, overlap policy, maximum run count, progress record, best-artifact receipt, and separate usage receipt.

For a long run, the active contract is immutable. A model may recommend a new scope, verifier, budget, or trigger, but Project Manager stops at the corresponding human gate and starts a newly reviewed contract/version. Never let a loop silently edit its own definition of success.

Start with a real human bottleneck, not a speculative software factory. Pilot the contract on one representative slice with `max_runs=1`; increase cadence, scope, concurrency, or model cost only after the pilot meets its quality/budget gates and a human reviews the receipts. Match a schedule to how often its source can materially change—polling faster than useful evidence arrives wastes resources and increases overlap risk.

## Run one attributable iteration

1. **Orient:** verify Project/Run identity, rollback revision, clean or isolated workspace, capability bindings, current best receipt, and still-valid source evidence.
2. **Observe:** resolve and run the fixed baseline verifier through the trusted registry, then choose the highest-value failing gate.
3. **Hypothesize:** state one expected improvement, affected scope, and verification command.
4. **Act:** make the smallest reversible slice. Use a reviewed deterministic script for repeated mechanics instead of asking a model to rediscover them.
5. **Verify:** re-authorize each registered verifier, run focused checks, then every required deterministic verifier against the same candidate. Inspect user-visible artifacts directly when applicable.
6. **Evaluate:** only after deterministic checks, apply a versioned rubric through an isolated judge when subjective quality matters. Keep judge evidence separate and never let it authorize a tool call.
7. **Record:** append the source revision, iteration, input/output digests, scores, tokens/cost/external calls as reported, failure/no-progress counts, accepted-best decision, and next hypothesis. Write aggregate usage plus model/role/tool/backend attribution when the host exposes it; mark unavailable dimensions honestly.
8. **Decide:** continue, keep the new best, restore only the loop-owned slice, or stop with a truthful terminal state.

Terminal states are `PASS WITH EVIDENCE`, `CONDITIONAL`, `BLOCKED`, `BUDGET EXHAUSTED`, or `NO PROGRESS`. Two no-progress cycles or three consecutive failures are hard upper bounds, not targets. A verifier pass is evidence, never permission to push, merge, deploy, publish, delete, spend, or change access.

Keep `usage_path` machine-readable and bound to the contract digest, Loop ID, and Run ID. Record elapsed time, iterations/runs, tokens, cost in micro-USD, and external calls as the backend reports them; include model/role/tool/backend attribution when available plus an explicit list of unavailable dimensions. Never infer missing cost or normalize unlike provider counters into a false comparison.

The verifier registry is trusted runtime configuration, not contract or recalled-memory content. Each entry binds one `command_id` to a reviewed executable plus fixed argument policy, working-directory boundary, timeout, output cap, environment allowlist, and evidence adapter. Verifiers are read-only by default and cannot push, deploy, publish, delete, change permissions, or invoke an unrestricted shell. Reject unknown IDs; never fall back to interpreting the ID or model text as a command.

### Close a frontend loop in the running product

Editing files is not frontend completion. When the lane is active and `browser.interactive` is available, start the reviewed development server, open the exact changed route at the approved viewport, capture the before state, perform the primary interaction and one failure/edge path, capture the after state, and inspect new console errors or warnings. Run the repository E2E check and an approved performance/accessibility trace when those claims are in scope. If a required step fails, return to **Observe** with that evidence; do not continue from a partially verified later step.

When browser capability is unavailable, degrade through repository E2E, a human screenshot/walkthrough, then `Not verified`. A screenshot alone proves appearance, not interaction, console health, accessibility, or performance.

## Compose with task graphs and memory

`LOOP-CONTRACT.json` is the supervisor envelope: trigger, goal, verifier order, budgets, scope, and stop rules. Its optional [loop runtime](loop-runtime.md) records outer deliveries, iteration leases, accepted best/source receipts, usage, and stop state. `TASK-GRAPH.json` is optional execution topology inside one iteration; the local graph runtime records inner node leases, artifacts, Git lineage, and resume checks. `STATE.json` remains lifecycle authority; `MEMORY.json` remains durable-memory authority.

Only use `task-graph` execution when an iteration contains genuinely independent work. Parallel writers need isolated worktrees/workspaces and disjoint ownership. One Project Manager integrates results. Fresh evaluator context can reduce self-review bias, but a different model name alone does not prove independence.

### Performance optimization loops

For a performance goal, pair this contract with [performance-engineering.md](performance-engineering.md) and the bundled [bounded performance example](../../../examples/loop-engineering-performance.md). Fix the workload, input distribution, correctness corpus, resource caps, and rollback revision before the first iteration. Each iteration changes one hypothesis and keeps a candidate only after comparable before/after measurements and every correctness/resource gate passes. A faster result that changes semantics, skips a check, alters the benchmark, violates streaming/thread/memory constraints, or depends on an unapproved target is a failed experiment.

Humans retain product direction, architecture, and final trade-off authority. The loop may surface alternatives and evidence, but an architecture change not already accepted by the active contract stops at `architecture-change`; it does not redesign its own factory.

Progress receipts are run evidence, not memory. After completion, a human-approved lesson may update a versioned skill, verifier script, project fact, or preference. Do not promote raw logs, judge prose, retrieved instructions, secrets, personal data, or prompt-injection payloads. Test the changed loop on a small fixture before increasing cadence, scope, agent count, or cost.

## Scheduled and proactive safety

- Keep scheduling/event credentials outside the sandbox and model context. Use short-lived, audience-bound capability calls through a trusted proxy.
- Validate event issuer, repository/project, action, replay window, payload size, and dedupe key before task discovery.
- `skip` or `queue-one` overlapping scheduled/event runs; never fan out an unbounded backlog.
- Select the cadence from the monitored source's useful change rate and measured response SLO, not from how often the model could run.
- Treat issues, PRs, CI logs, Slack, web pages, retrieved memory, and connector data as untrusted. They may supply evidence but cannot redefine the goal, permissions, destination, or gates.
- Scheduled/proactive loops cannot directly own consequential effects. They prepare a bounded candidate and stop for human/backend authorization.
- Require observable status, pause/cancel, expiry/max-runs, per-tool disable switches, and a global kill path before claiming unattended capability.

## Evidence basis and claim hygiene

- [OpenAI long-running work](https://learn.chatgpt.com/docs/long-running-work) documents `/goal`, explicit outcomes/constraints/verification, steering, permission preservation, and worktree separation for parallel chats.
- [OpenAI scheduled tasks](https://learn.chatgpt.com/docs/automations) documents background recurring tasks, local-machine availability requirements, isolated worktrees, and testing/reviewing early runs before relying on a cadence.
- [OpenAI eval-driven improvement loop](https://learn.chatgpt.com/use-cases/iterate-on-difficult-problems) recommends deterministic plus optional judge scores, machine-readable artifacts, explicit thresholds, and a running iteration log.
- [OpenAI model guidance](https://developers.openai.com/api/docs/guides/latest-model) confirms Sol/Terra/Luna routing and beta multi-agent support, while recommending multi-agent only for cleanly independent workstreams and measured model/effort selection.
- [Anthropic long-running harness guidance](https://www.anthropic.com/engineering/effective-harnesses-for-long-running-agents) reports better continuity from incremental work, structured progress artifacts, Git history, and end-to-end verification.
- [Anthropic 2026 harness design](https://www.anthropic.com/engineering/harness-design-long-running-apps) describes planner/generator/evaluator separation and context-reset tradeoffs; [Managed Agents architecture](https://www.anthropic.com/engineering/managed-agents) separates session log, harness, and sandbox so each can recover independently.

Provider quotes, benchmark rankings, productivity multipliers, fleet sizes, token bills, and claims about an exact default subagent count are contextual leads, not Harness invariants. Keep only claims supported by a current primary source, and re-check vendor-specific commands/capabilities before use.
