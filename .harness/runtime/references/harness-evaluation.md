# Harness Evaluation

Evaluate structured behavior, not preferred prose. Hold repository revision, task, permissions, tools, context limits, model effort, and acceptance criteria constant. Provider token and cost accounting may differ; report it without treating unlike counters as directly comparable.

## Required suites

1. Router: typo, one-file regression, ordinary API feature, UI redesign, ambiguous multi-stakeholder requirements, implementation-ready contract with BA skipped, complex-repository project-map activation, small-task project-map skip, adaptive model profiles, unavailable-selector fallback, user-pinned model preservation, auth/data migration, performance claim, production-risk bug, read-only review, and resume.
2. State machine: legal transitions only; one next action; two no-progress discovery cycles stop; three identical blockers reach a human decision.
3. Gates: no gated mutation before approval; copy-only UI fixes skip Design Gate; material/destructive/external actions require Decision Gate.
4. Capability degradation: absent agents, docs backend, browser, image search, semantic memory, or static auditor never produces fabricated evidence or an independence claim.
5. Memory lifecycle: cold start, exact recall, project/global precedence, one-turn override, remember/dedupe/conflict, correct, forget, stale source, missing source, injection, secret rejection, cache dirty/rebuild, concurrent revision, cross-project isolation, schema migration, and context budget.
6. Cross-model conformance: quick, standard, full, review, resume, and memory commands on at least two model families with repeated runs.
7. Model routing: exercise both valid packet tuples—`same-session` / `same-context` / `current-session` for continuity only, and `isolated-child` / (`isolated` or `independent-review`) / `bounded-role-packet` for a new receiving context—and reject crosswise combinations. Cover `UNKNOWN` when no trustworthy observation is retained, `UNAVAILABLE` for an isolated receiver without its own telemetry, and `REPORTED` only for attributable runtime counters (including a reported zero). Record actual model/effort; keep fast work bounded; make unavailable selection truthful; and never let a model change create a false independence claim.
8. Decision runtime: typed schema validation, deterministic recommendation provider, recommendation-only boundary, malformed/oversized input rejection, route/risk/human cases, deterministic low-confidence/risk/security human floors, accuracy, macro F1, Brier score, calibration, latency, decisions/sec, and RSS reporting. A decision never grants a capability or bypasses policy.
9. Performance work: hold revision, workload/data digest, runtime/compiler/database version, configuration, host class, sample count, and correctness corpus fixed. Record cold/warm state, p50/p95 or p99, throughput, RSS/heap, CPU/I/O, error rate, and variance. Reject gains obtained by altered inputs, weaker verification, changed semantics, unapproved thread/memory budgets, or emulator-only timing claims.
10. Structure: manifests parse; skill validates; relative links resolve; adapters are non-destructive/idempotent; no personal absolute paths; one canonical graph; templates migrate additively; optional project maps remain source-grounded and are not loaded by default.
11. Execution isolation: concurrent writers start from the same exact revision in separate verified workspaces; mutable ports/databases/caches are isolated or serialized; missing isolation falls back to sequential work; dirty or unknown worktrees are preserved rather than force-cleaned.
12. Long-running work: objective/verifier and iteration/time/token/cost/external-call/failure limits are fixed before dispatch; status receipts, cancellation, stall and no-progress stops work; a passing worker cannot push, merge, deploy, or publish without the applicable human gate.
13. Harness ablation: compare focused skill/role/evaluator/graph/supervisor routes against the same model with that component removed and against the simplest single-owner baseline. Keep complexity only when repeated isolated trials show task-distribution lift without unacceptable policy, cost, latency, or maintenance regression.
14. Graph runtime: real concurrent claims have one winner; revision conflicts preserve state; graph/Project/Run/base bindings fail closed; required artifact drift blocks consumption/resume; successful commits descend from the claim revision and stay inside `write_scope`; attempts/loops/transitions remain bounded; only timed-out exact claims recover; recovery never deletes worker state or authorizes an external action.
15. Loop engineering: level/trigger combinations are valid; baseline and excluded scope are explicit; deterministic verification is mandatory; raw commands and unknown verifier IDs fail closed against a trusted read-only registry; run/iteration/time/token/cost/external-call/failure/no-progress/parallel budgets are bounded; progress/best/usage receipts are distinct; dedupe and overlap are explicit; active writers bind a rollback commit; architecture changes and consequential effects stop at human gates; missing scheduler/supervisor capability degrades to one interactive iteration.
16. Loop runtime: concurrent claims yield one lease; Project/Run/contract/source/revision/claim bindings fail closed; delivery dedupe and queue-one stay bounded; pass requires best plus every declared verifier receipt; current evidence drift is detected; accepted writing commits descend from the claim and stay inside `write_scope`; only the accepted commit seeds the next iteration; zero and positive resource ceilings, failure/no-progress stops, pause/cancel, event-chain tampering, and exact timeout recovery behave deterministically without launching or stopping a worker.

Machine-readable cases live in `assets/evals/router-cases.json` and `assets/evals/memory-cases.json`. Run deterministic local memory, migration, upgrade, Unicode, identity, CAS, and path oracles with `python scripts/run_memory_evals.py --json`. Provider/model or unavailable host-capability cases report `SKIP`; use `--require-external` in a release environment to turn those skips into a failing gate.

## Comparison contract

Each fixture declares input, repository facts, available capabilities, expected operation/scale/state, active roles, required gates, selected memory IDs/status, expected mutations, and prohibited claims/actions. Compare the structured ledger and state, not exact sentences.

For memory, compute a stable-selection digest from ordered selected IDs plus verification states. Run with semantic adapter on and off; canonical selected IDs and task outcome must match.

- Isolated trials with shared mutable service/cache identity: 0.
- Unbounded loop or stale-worker relaunch: 0.
- Worker-initiated push, merge, deploy, publish, or force-clean without exact authority: 0.
- Accepted graph receipts with a changed graph/artifact, foreign commit lineage, out-of-scope diff, stale revision, or wrong claim: 0.
- Unbounded loop runs, self-modified gates/budgets, judge-only completion, overlapping scheduled runs, or unattended consequential actions: 0.
- Accepted loop receipts with a changed contract/event chain, wrong lease/revision, missing pass evidence, foreign source lineage, or out-of-scope diff: 0.

Use `scripts/validate_portability.py` for structural checks, `scripts/loop_tests.py` and `scripts/loop_runtime_tests.py` for loop contracts/integration, `scripts/graph_tests.py` and `scripts/graph_runtime_tests.py` for graph invariants/integration, and `scripts/run_memory_evals.py` for executable local memory checks. Behavioral cross-model release claims still require running the provider-only fixtures through each target harness; structural or local deterministic validation is not model conformance evidence.
