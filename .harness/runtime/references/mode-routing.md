# Adaptive Mode Routing

Scale and operation are independent. Record `operation`, `requested_scale`, `selected_scale`, and `selection_reason` in `STATE.json`.

## Operations

| Operation | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `start` | Start a new delivery run. This is the default. |
| `resume` | Validate project identity and state, then continue the one recorded next action. |
| `review` | Keep implementation roles read-only and return severity-ordered findings. |
| `init` | Create missing canonical files and approved provider adapters without overwriting existing content. |
| memory command | Run the lightweight memory protocol without the delivery graph. |

An explicit operation wins. An unfinished run means `run_id` is non-empty and state is not `DONE`. With no explicit operation: a request containing a clearly new task uses `start`; no new task plus a validated unfinished run uses `resume`; a request that clearly continues the active objective also uses `resume`. If the new request and active run overlap ambiguously, ask whether to resume or start rather than replacing state silently. A freshly initialized blank state is not unfinished. `review` may combine with any scale. Resume retains its selected scale unless new evidence requires escalation or the human explicitly changes it.

## Deterministic scale selection

1. An explicit `full`, `standard`, or `quick` selects that scale. Never downgrade explicit `full`. If explicit `quick` is unsafe, pause and recommend escalation before material work.
2. With `auto`, select `full` when any full trigger applies.
3. Otherwise select `quick` only when every quick condition applies.
4. Otherwise select `standard`.

Full triggers: security, privacy, authentication/authorization, schema or data migration, concurrency correctness, production/external mutation, irreversible work, multi-service architecture, incident/release readiness, material dependency or supply-chain risk, performance/scale claims, unattended scheduled/event/proactive execution, or uncertainty that can change architecture or authorization.

Quick requires all of these: one bounded domain, unambiguous acceptance, low risk, no material external effect, no durable architecture/schema choice, and a deterministic focused verification path. A typo, isolated style correction, or proven one-file regression often qualifies.

Standard covers normal multi-file bugs and features, cross-component work, and product changes without a full trigger.

Escalate only upward when evidence changes the classification. Record the trigger and continue from the current state; do not discard valid completed work.

## Task-graph routing

Graph Engineering does not change the selected scale. Activate the optional per-run task graph only when one of these is true: the human explicitly requests it; two or more jobs can run independently after a stable contract and later fan in; the work crosses meaningful module/service ownership; a clear deterministic rubric justifies a bounded evaluator loop; or an expensive-to-undo effect needs an explicit human predecessor.

Skip it for `quick`, a strictly sequential migration or reasoning chain, or a tool-dense task where every worker needs the same evolving context. Use a single-owner chain in those cases. For an active graph choose the smallest shape from [graph-engineering.md](graph-engineering.md), cap concurrency and transitions, and validate `.harness/TASK-GRAPH.json` before scheduling nodes.

## Loop-contract routing

Loop Engineering does not automatically require a task graph. Activate `.harness/LOOP-CONTRACT.json` when the user explicitly requests a loop/goal/schedule/proactive workflow, when the task must repeat across session boundaries, or when an evaluator-optimizer needs multiple measurable iterations. Skip it for normal one-turn work and short sequential tasks even if they contain an ordinary internal retry.

Use `turn` or `goal` for human-started work. `scheduled` and `proactive` require verified schedule/event plus supervision capabilities; otherwise preserve the contract but run one bounded interactive iteration and return a handoff. Validate the contract with [loop-engineering.md](loop-engineering.md) before execution. A task graph is added inside the loop only when one iteration truly splits into independent jobs.

## Requirements-pass routing

Trigger the Business Analyst pass when one material item is unresolved: business outcome, primary actor or stakeholder, in/out scope, source of a business rule, conflict between stakeholders or requirements, observable acceptance behavior, or a high-impact workflow such as payment, approval, permissions, regulated processing, or an external integration. Inspect repository evidence first; do not turn discoverable facts into human questions.

Skip the pass for an implementation-ready bug, refactor, copy/style fix, or technical task with an approved contract and testable acceptance criteria. In `quick`, PM performs any tiny requirements check inline. In `standard`, run the pass only on trigger. In `full`, keep the pass conditional but isolate it when stakeholder or rule complexity makes independent analysis useful.

The pass runs within `INTAKE` or `PLAN`, writes no shared state, and adds no gate. It returns a compact requirement baseline to PM. BA owns **what/why** and unresolved business intent; Planner/Architect owns **how** and technical contracts. Requirement decisions use the existing Plan or Decision checkpoint.

## Roles and gates

| Scale | Typical active roles | Human checkpoints |
|---|---|---|
| quick | PM, one applicable implementer, deterministic QA pass; BA folded into PM; Researcher/Designer only on trigger | Decision when material; Acceptance summary for delivery |
| standard | PM, Planner, applicable specialists, QA; BA/Researcher/Designer and task graph conditional | Concise plan checkpoint for material scope; conditional Design/Decision; Acceptance for delivery |
| full | PM, Planner, Researcher, every applicable specialist, isolated QA when available; BA and task graph still conditional | Bounded discovery, Plan, conditional Design, Decision as needed, Acceptance for delivery |

Do not activate a role or gate merely because its row exists. The Design Gate triggers only for a new or changed visual direction, flow/information architecture, design system, motion contract, or third-party asset choice.

## Authorization and completion

Plan and Design checkpoints resolve material choices, not routine implementation details. A clear user request or an earlier approved requirement/design/model plan supplies authorization within that scope; record it rather than asking for the same approval again. A changed scope, unresolved material architecture/schema decision, breaking or destructive effect, new credential/paid-service use, production mutation, or external communication needs authorization that covers that specific action. Platform permission prompts do not substitute for product decisions.

Continue authorized implementation, runtime inspection where relevant, and repairs for change-caused failures. Tests verified to use disposable fixtures without production access may run and be rerun within this scope. Stop for genuinely missing authority or a material unresolved choice, an explicit review boundary, or an evidence-backed blocker—not merely because a first implementation is ready.

Technical readiness and human acceptance are separate checkpoints. Finish applicable verification and report remaining limitations before requesting acceptance. Canonical delivery state then waits at `WAITING_ACCEPTANCE`; only human acceptance permits `DONE` and exact-run memory closure. Read-only reviews end with findings and no memory mutation.

## Review semantics

- `review quick`: one bounded artifact or diff and focused checks.
- `review standard`: ordinary repository/diff review with applicable domains.
- `review full`: release, incident, security/privacy, architecture, performance/scale, or explicitly deep audit.

Review never authorizes implementation, external mutation, hidden cleanup, or durable-memory mutation. It ends with a findings handoff rather than an Acceptance Gate unless the user explicitly starts a remediation run. A same-agent review is labeled `self-review`; only isolated context and ownership may be labeled `independent QA`.
